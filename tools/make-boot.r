; one "args" to be looked at in the long run.  This is an attempt to still

; as well as function either from the command line or the REPL.

=== SET UP COLLECTION OF SYMBOL NUMBERS ===

; !!! The symbol strategy in Ren-C is expected to move to using a fixed table
; of words that commit to their identity, as opposed to picking on each build.
; Concept would be to fit every common word that would be used in Rebol to
; the low 65535 indices, while allowing numbers beyond that to be claimed
; over time...so they could still be used in C switch() statements (but might
; have to be stored and managed in a less efficient way)
;
; For now, the symbols are gathered from the various phases, and can change
; as things are added or removed.  Hence C code using SYM_XXX must be
; recompiled with changes to the core.  These symbols aren't in libRebol,
; however, so it only affects clients of the core API for now.
