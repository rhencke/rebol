        ; %f-deci.c is a lot of twiddly custom C code for implementing a fixed
        ; precision math type, that was for some reason a priority in R3-Alpha
        ; but isn't very central to Ren-C.  It is not a priority to audit
        ; it for speed, so allow it to be slow if MSVC compiles with /Qspectre
