; In historical Rebol, UNLESS was a synonym for IF NOT.  This somewhat
; unambitious use of the word has been replaced in Ren-C with an enfix
; operator that is siilar to a non-short-circuit OR, but prefers the right
; hand side's result:
;
;     >> x: {default} unless (case [1 > 2 [{nope}] 3 > 4 [{not this either}]])
;     >> print x
;     default
;
; !!! This may not wind up being kept:
