; UNWIND allows one to name specific stack levels to jump up to
; and return a value from.  It uses the same mechanism as RETURN

(<good> = if 1 < 2 [eval does [reduce [unwind :if <good> | <bad1>] <bad2>]])

; UNWIND the IF should stop the loop
(
    cycle?: true
    f1: does [
        if 1 < 2 [
            while [cycle?] [cycle?: false | unwind :if]
            <bad>
        ]
        <good>
    ]
    <good> = f1
)
