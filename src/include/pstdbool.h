// 0 is defined in C as "conditionally false", while all non-zero things are
// considered "conditionally true".  Yet the language standard mandates that
// comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, etc) will return either 0 or 1, and
// the C++ language standard defines conversion of its built-in boolean type
// to an integral value as either 0 or 1.
//
// This could be exploited by optimized code *IF* it could truly trust a true
// "boolean" is exactly 0 or 1. But unfortunately, C only standardized an
// actual boolean type in C99 with <stdbool.h>.  Older compilers have to use
// integral types for booleans, and may wind up with bugs like this:
//
//     #define fake_bool int
//     int My_Optimized_Function(fake_bool bit) {
//         return bit << 4; // should be 16 if logic is TRUE, 0 if FALSE
//     }
//     int zero_or_sixteen = My_Optimized_Function(flags & SOME_BIT_FLAG);
//
// This code shims in a definition of bool as 0 or 1 for older compilers.
// It is *not safe* in a general sense, but since parts of the code use the
// word `bool` it would have to be defined *somewhere* for the code to compile
// on platforms without it!
