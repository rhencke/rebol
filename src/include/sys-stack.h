// The data stack (DS_) is for pushing one individual REBVAL at a time.  The
// values can then be popped in a Last-In-First-Out way.  It is also possible
// to mark a stack position, do any number of pushes, and then ask for the
// range of values pushed since the mark to be placed into a REBARR array.
// As long as a value is on the data stack, any series it refers to will be
// protected from being garbage-collected.
//
// A notable usage of the data stack is by REDUCE and COMPOSE.  They use it
// to gather values prior to their insertion into a final array.  It's better
// for many clients to use the data stack as a common preallocated working
// space.  This way the size of the accumulated result is known, preventing
// wasting space on expansions or resizes and shuffling due to a guessed size.
//
// The data stack has many applications, and can be used by any piece of the
// system.  But there is a rule that when that piece is finished, it must
// "balance" the stack back to where it was when it was called!  There is
// a check in the main evaluator loop that the stack has been balanced to
// wherever it started by the time a function call ends.  However, it is not
// necessary to balance the stack in the case of calling a `fail`--because
// it will be automatically restored to where it was at the PUSH_TRAP().
//
// To speed pushes and pops to the stack while also making sure that each
// push is tested to see if an expansion is needed, a trick is used.  This
// trick is to grow the stack in blocks, and always maintain that the block
// has an END marker at its point of capacity--and ensure that there are no
// end markers between the DSP and that capacity.  This way, if a push runs
// up against an END it knows to do an expansion.
//

// DSP stands for "(D)ata (S)tack "(P)osition", and is the index of the top
// of the data stack (last valid item in the underlying array)
//
#define DSP \
    cast(REBDSP, DS_Index) // cast helps stop ++DSP, etc.

// DS_TOP is the most recently pushed item.
//
#define DS_TOP \
    cast(REBVAL*, DS_Movable_Top) // cast helps stop ++DS_TOP, etc.

// DS_AT accesses value at given stack location.  It is allowed to point at
// a stack location that is an end, e.g. DS_AT(dsp + 1), because that location
// may be used as the start of a copy which is ultimately of length 0.

// PUSHING
//
// If you push "unsafe" trash to the stack, it has the benefit of costing
// nothing extra in a release build for setting the value (as it is just
// left uninitialized).  But you must make sure that a GC can't run before
// you have put a valid value into the slot you pushed.
//
// If the stack runs out of capacity then it will be expanded by the basis
// defined below.  The number is arbitrary and should be tuned.  Note the
// number of bytes will be sizeof(REBVAL) * STACK_EXPAND_BASIS
//

//
// POPPING
//
// Since it's known that END markers were never pushed, a pop can just leave
// whatever bits had been previously pushed, dropping only the index.  The
// only END marker will be the one indicating the tail of the stack.

// Rebol doesn't want to crash in the event of a stack overflow, but would
// like to gracefully trap it and return the user to the console.  While it
// is possible for Rebol to set a limit to how deeply it allows function
// calls in the interpreter to recurse, there's no *portable* way to
// catch a stack overflow in the C code of the interpreter itself.
//
// Hence, by default Rebol will use a non-standard heuristic.  A flag is
// passed to say if OS_STACK_GROWS_UP.  If so, it then extrapolates that C
// function call frames will be laid out consecutively, and the memory
// difference between a stack variable in the topmost stacks can be checked
// against some limit.
//
// This has nothing to do with guarantees in the C standard, and compilers
// can really put variables at any address they feel like:
//
// http://stackoverflow.com/a/1677482/211160
//
// Additionally, it puts the burden on every recursive or deeply nested
// routine to sprinkle calls to the C_STACK_OVERFLOWING macro somewhere
// in it.  The ideal answer is to make Rebol itself corral an interpreted
// script such that it can't cause the C code to stack overflow.  Lacking
// that ideal this technique could break, so build configurations should
// be able to turn it off if needed.
//
// In the meantime, C_STACK_OVERFLOWING is a macro which takes the
// address of some variable local to the currently executed function.
// Note that because the limit is noticed before the C stack has *actually*
// overflowed, you still have a bit of stack room to do the cleanup and
// raise an error trap.  (You need to take care of any unmanaged series
// allocations, etc).  So cleaning up that state should be doable without
// making deep function calls.
//
// !!! Future approaches should look into use of Windows stack exceptions
// or libsigsegv:
