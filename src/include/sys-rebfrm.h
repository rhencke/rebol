//
// The primary routine that handles DO and EVALUATE is Eval_Core().  It
// takes a single parameter which holds the running state of the evaluator.
// This state may be allocated on the C variable stack.
//
// Eval_Core() is written so that a longjmp to a failure handler above
// it can do cleanup safely even though intermediate stacks have vanished.
// This is because Push_Frame and Drop_Frame maintain an independent global
// list of the frames in effect, so that the Fail_Core() routine can unwind
// all the associated storage and structures for each frame.
//
// Ren-C can not only run the evaluator across a REBARR-style series of
// input based on index, it can also enumerate through C's `va_list`,
// providing the ability to pass pointers as REBVAL* in a variadic function
// call from the C (comma-separated arguments, as with printf()).  Future data
// sources might also include a REBVAL[] raw C array.
//
// To provide even greater flexibility, it allows the very first element's
// pointer in an evaluation to come from an arbitrary source.  It doesn't
// have to be resident in the same sequence from which ensuing values are
// pulled, allowing a free head value (such as an ACTION! REBVAL in a local
// C variable) to be evaluated in combination from another source (like a
// va_list or series representing the arguments.)  This avoids the cost and
// complexity of allocating a series to combine the values together.
//


// Default for Eval_Core_May_Throw() is just a single EVALUATE step.

// be `(summation 1 2 3) |> 100` and not `summation 1 2 (3 |> 100)`.  This

// The flags are resident in the frame after the frame's cell.  In order to
// let the cell act like a terminated array (if one needs that), the flags

//
// Due to the unusual influences of partial refinement specialization, a frame
// may wind up with its enfix parameter as being something like the last cell
// in the argument list...when it has to then go back and fill earlier args
// as normal.  There's no good place to hold the memory that one is doing an
// enfix fulfillment besides a bit on the frame itself.
//
// IF EVAL_FLAG_PATH_MODE...
//
// The way setting of paths is historically designed, it can't absolutely
// give back a location of a variable to be set...since sometimes the result
// is generated, or accessed as a modification of an immediate value.  This
// complicates the interface to where the path dispatcher must be handed
// the value to set and copy itself if necessary.  But CELL_MASK_COPIED does
// not carry forward CELL_FLAG_ENFIXED in the assignment.  This flag tells
// a frame used with SET-PATH! semantics to make its final assignment enfix.

//
// There is a contention between operators that want to quote their left hand
// side and ones that want to quote their right hand side.  The left hand side
// wins in order for things like `help default` to work.  But deciding on
// whether the left hand side should win or not if it's a PATH! is a tricky
// case, as one must evaluate the path to know if it winds up producing a
// right quoting action or not.
//
// So paths win automatically unless a special (rare) override is used.  But
// if that path doesn't end up being a right quoting operator, it's less
// confusing to give an error message informing the user to use -> vs. just
// make it appear there was no left hand side.

//=//// EVAL_FLAG_ERROR_ON_DEFERRED_ENFIX /////////////////////////////////=//
//
// There are advanced features that "abuse" the evaluator, e.g. by making it
// create a specialization exemplar by example from a stream of code.  These
// cases are designed to operate in isolation, and are incompatible with the
// idea of enfix operations that stay pending in the evaluation queue, e.g.
//
//     match parse "aab" [some "a" end] else [print "what should this do?"]
//
// MATCH is variadic, and in one step asks to make a frame from the right
// hand side.  But it's 99% likely intent of this was to attach the ELSE to
// the MATCH and not the PARSE.  That looks inconsistent, since the user
// imagines it's the evaluator running PARSE as a parameter to MATCH (vs.
// MATCH becoming the evaluator and running it).
//
// It would be technically possible to allow ELSE to bind to the MATCH in
// this case.  It might even be technically possible to give MATCH back a
// frame for a CHAIN of actions that starts with PARSE but includes the ELSE
// (which sounds interesting but crazy, considering that's not what people
// would want here, but maybe sometimes they would).
//
// The best answer for right now is just to raise an error.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_ERROR_ON_DEFERRED_ENFIX \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(23)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_REQUOTE_NULL ////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Most routines that try to pass through the quoted level of their input
// can't process a dequoted null (e.g. don't have <opt> input).  Hence if
// a quoted input comes in like '''FOO, but the routine decides to return
// null as a signal, it wants to give back plain null and not ''' as a
// triple-quoted null.
//
// But we use the heuristic that if a routine intentionally takes nulls, then
// a quoted null on input signals requoting a null on output.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_REQUOTE_NULL \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(24)


//=//// EVAL_FLAG_FULLY_SPECIALIZED ///////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// When a null is seen in f->special, the question is whether that is an
// intentional "null specialization" or if it means the argument should be
// gathered normally (if applicable), as it would in a typical invocation.
// If the frame is considered fully specialized (as with DO F) then there
// will be no further argument gathered at the callsite, nulls are as-is.
//
#define EVAL_FLAG_FULLY_SPECIALIZED \

//=//// EVAL_FLAG_NO_RESIDUE //////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Sometimes a single step evaluation is done in which it would be considered
// an error if all of the arguments are not used.  This requests an error if
// the frame does not reach the end.
//
// !!! Interactions with ELIDE won't currently work with this, so evaluation
// would have to take this into account to greedily run ELIDEs if the flag
// is set.  However, it's only used in variadic apply at the moment with
// calls from the system that do not use ELIDE.  These calls may someday
// turn into rebRun(), in which case the mechanism would need rethinking.
//
// !!! A userspace tool for doing this was once conceived as `||`, which
// was variadic and would only allow one evaluation step after it, after
// which it would need to reach either an END or another `||`.

//=//// EVAL_FLAG_DOING_PICKUPS ///////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// If an ACTION! is invoked through a path and uses refinements in a different
// order from how they appear in the frame's parameter definition, then the
// arguments at the callsite can't be gathered in sequence.  Revisiting them
// will be necessary.  This flag is set while they are revisited, which is
// important not only for Eval_Core() to know, but also the GC...since it
// means it must protect *all* of the arguments--not just up thru f->param.

// IF EVAL_FLAG_PATH_MODE...
//
// It is technically possible to produce a new specialized ACTION! each
// time you used a PATH!.  This is needed for `apdo: :append/dup/only` as a
// method of partial specialization, but would be costly if just invoking
// a specialization once.  So path dispatch can be asked to push the path
// refinements in the reverse order of their invocation.
//
// This mechanic is also used by SPECIALIZE, so that specializing refinements
// in order via a path and values via a block of code can be done in one
// step, vs needing to make an intermediate ACTION!.
//

// dodge having to check the flag on every dispatch.  But in the scheme of
// things, checking the flag is negligible...and it's better to do it with
// a flag so that one does not lose the paramlist information one was working

    // but also because it is used as a temporary to store value if it is
    // advanced but we'd like to hold the old one...this makes it important

    // fulfillment, see In_Typecheck_Mode()
    //
    // If arguments are actually being fulfilled into the slots, those
    // slots start out as trash.  Yet the GC has access to the frame list,

    // bits that haven't been fulfilled yet.

    // non-null values are being written vs. acquiring callsite parameters.
    //
    // It is assumed that special, param, and arg may all be incremented
    // together at the same time...reducing conditionality (this is why it
    // is `param` and not nullptr when processing unspecialized).

    // `IS_END(pvs->value + 1)` before setting.
