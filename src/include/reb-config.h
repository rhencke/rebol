// This is the first file included by %sys-core.h.
//
// Many of the flags controlling the build (such as
// the TO_<target> definitions) come from -DTO_<target> in the
// compiler command-line.  These command lines are generally
// produced automatically, based on the build that is picked
// from %systems.r.
//
// However, some flags require the preprocessor's help to
// decide if they are relevant, for instance if they involve
// detecting features of the compiler while it's running.
// Or they may adjust a feature so narrowly that putting it
// into the system configuration would seem unnecessary.
//
// Over time, this file should be balanced and adjusted with
// %systems.r in order to make the most convenient and clear
// build process.  If there is difficulty in making a build
// work on a system, use that as an opportunity to reflect
// how to make this better.

/** Primary Configuration **********************************************

The primary target system is defined by:

    TO_(os-base)    - for example TO_WINDOWS or TO_LINUX
    TO_(os-name)    - for example TO_WINDOWS_X86 or TO_LINUX_X64

The default config builds an R3 HOST executable program.

To change the config, host-kit developers can define:

    REB_EXT         - build an extension module
                      * create a DLL, not a host executable
                      * do not export a host lib (OS_ lib)
                      * call r3lib via struct and macros

    REB_CORE        - build /core only, no graphics, windows, etc.

Special internal defines used by RT, not Host-Kit developers:

    REB_API         - build r3lib as API
                      * export r3lib functions
                      * build r3lib dispatch table
                      * call host lib (OS_) via struct and macros

    REB_EXE         - build r3 as a standalone executable
*/

// which had a Motorola 68040 cannot built Rebol.

// for an Amiga emulator.  The last known successful build on
// Amiga hardware is dated 5-Mar-2011
