// REBVAL is the structure/union for all Rebol values. It's designed to be
// four C pointers in size (so 16 bytes on 32-bit platforms and 32 bytes
// on 64-bit platforms).  Operation will be most efficient with those sizes,
// and there are checks on boot to ensure that `sizeof(REBVAL)` is the
// correct value for the platform.  But from a mechanical standpoint, the
// system should be *able* to work even if the size is different.
//
// Of the four 32-or-64-bit slots that each value has, the first is used for
// the value's "Header".  This includes the data type, such as REB_INTEGER,
// REB_BLOCK, REB_TEXT, etc.  Then there are flags which are for general
// purposes that could apply equally well to any type of value (including
// whether the value should have a new-line after it when molded out inside
// of a block).  Followed by that are bits which are custom to each type (for
// instance whether a key in an object is hidden or not).
//
// Obviously, an arbitrary long string won't fit into the remaining 3*32 bits,
// or even 3*64 bits!  You can fit the data for an INTEGER or DECIMAL in that
// (at least until they become arbitrary precision) but it's not enough for
// a generic BLOCK! or an ACTION! (for instance).  So the remaining bits
// often will point to one or more Rebol "nodes" (see %sys-series.h for an
// explanation of REBSER, REBARR, REBCTX, and REBMAP.)
//
// So the next part of the structure is the "Extra".  This is the size of one
// pointer, which sits immediately after the header (that's also the size of
// one pointer).
//
// This sets things up for the "Payload"--which is the size of two pointers.
// It is broken into a separate structure at this position so that on 32-bit
// platforms, it can be aligned on a 64-bit boundary (assuming the REBVAL's
// starting pointer was aligned on a 64-bit boundary to start with).  This is
// important for 64-bit value processing on 32-bit platforms, which will
// either be slow or crash if reads of 64-bit floating points/etc. are done
// on unaligned locations.

//=//// CELL_FLAG_PROTECTED ///////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Values can carry a user-level protection bit.  The bit is not copied by
// Move_Value(), and hence reading a protected value and writing it to
// another location will not propagate the protectedness from the original
// value to the copy.
//
// This is called a CELL_FLAG and not a VALUE_FLAG because any formatted cell
// can be tested for it, even if it is "trash".  This means writing routines
// that are putting data into a cell for the first time can check the bit.
// (Series, having more than one kind of protection, put those bits in the
// "info" so they can all be checked at once...otherwise there might be a
// shared NODE_FLAG_PROTECTED in common.)

//=//// VALUE_FLAG_FALSEY /////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This flag is used as a quick cache on NULL, BLANK! or LOGIC! false values.
// These are the only three values that return true from the NOT native
// (a.k.a. "conditionally false").  All other types return true from TO-LOGIC
// or its synonym, "DID".
//
// (It is also placed on END cells and TRASH cells, to speed up the VAL_TYPE()
// check for finding illegal types...by only checking falsey types.)
//
// Because of this cached bit, LOGIC! does not need to store any data in its
// payload... its data of being true or false is already covered by this
// header bit.
//
#define VALUE_FLAG_FALSEY \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(17)


//=//// VALUE_FLAG_NEWLINE_BEFORE /////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// When the array containing a value with this flag set is molding, that will
// output a new line *before* molding the value.  This flag works in tandem
// with a flag on the array itself which manages whether there should be a
// newline output before the closing array delimiter: ARRAY_FLAG_TAIL_NEWLINE.
//
// The bit is set initially by what the scanner detects, and then left to the
// user's control after that.
//
// !!! The native `new-line` is used set this, which has a somewhat poor
// name considering its similarity to `newline` the line feed char.
//
// !!! Currently, ANY-PATH! rendering just ignores this bit.  Some way of
// representing paths with newlines in them may be needed.
//
#define VALUE_FLAG_NEWLINE_BEFORE \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(18)


//=//// VALUE_FLAG_UNEVALUATED ////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Some functions wish to be sensitive to whether or not their argument came
// as a literal in source or as a product of an evaluation.  While all values
// carry the bit, it is only guaranteed to be meaningful on arguments in
// function frames...though it is valid on any result at the moment of taking
// it from Eval_Core_Throws().
//
// It is in the negative sense because the act of requesting it is uncommon,
// e.g. from the QUOTE operator.  So most Init_Blank() or other assignment
// should default to being "evaluative".
//
// !!! This concept is somewhat dodgy and experimental, but it shows promise
// in addressing problems like being able to give errors if a user writes
// something like `if [x > 2] [print "true"]` vs. `if x > 2 [print "true"]`,
// while still tolerating `item: [a b c] | if item [print "it's an item"]`. 
// That has a lot of impact for the new user experience.
//
#define VALUE_FLAG_UNEVALUATED \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(19)


//=//// VALUE_FLAG_ENFIXED ////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// In Ren-C, there is only one kind of function (ACTION!).  But it's possible
// to tag a function value cell in a context as being "enfixed", hence it
// will acquire its first argument from the left.  See SET/ENFIX and ENFIX.
//
// The reasion it is a generic VALUE_FLAG_XXX and not an ACTION_FLAG_XXX is
// so that it can be dealt with without specifically knowing that the cell
// involved is an action.  One benefit is that testing for an enfix action
// can be done just by looking at this bit--since only actions have it set.
//
// But also, this bit is not copied by Move_Value.  As a result, if you say
// something like `foo: :+`, foo will contain the non-enfixed form of the
// function.  To do that would require more nuance in Move_Value if it were
// an ACTION_FLAG_XXX, testing for action-ness vs. just masking it out.
//
#define VALUE_FLAG_ENFIXED \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(20)


//=//// VALUE_FLAG_EVAL_FLIP //////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This is a bit which should not be present on cells in user-exposed arrays.
//
// If a DO is happening with DO_FLAG_EXPLICIT_EVALUATE, only values which
// carry this bit will override it.  It may be the case that the flag on a
// value would signal a kind of quoting to suppress evaluation in ordinary
// evaluation (without DO_FLAG_EXPLICIT_EVALUATE), hence it is a "flip" bit.
//
#define VALUE_FLAG_EVAL_FLIP \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(21) // IMPORTANT: Same bit as DO_FLAG_EXPLICIT_EVALUATE


//=//// VALUE_FLAG_CONST //////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// A value that is CONST has read-only access to any series or data it points
// to, regardless of whether that data is in a locked series or not.  It is
// possible to get a mutable view on a const value by using MUTABLE, and a
// const view on a mutable value with CONST.
//
#define VALUE_FLAG_CONST \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(22) // NOTE: Must be SAME BIT as DO_FLAG_CONST


//=//// VALUE_FLAG_EXPLICITLY_MUTABLE /////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// While it may seem that a mutable value would be merely one that did not
// carry VALUE_FLAG_CONST, there's a need for a separate bit to indicate when
// MUTABLE has been specified explicitly.  That way, evaluative situations
// like `do mutable compose [...]` or `make object! mutable load ...` can
// realize that they should switch into a mode which doesn't enforce const
// by default--which it would ordinarily do.
//
// If this flag did not exist, then to get the feature of disabled mutability
// would require every such operation taking something like a /MUTABLE
// refinement.  This moves the flexibility onto the values themselves.
//
// While CONST can be added by the system implicitly during an evaluation,
// the MUTABLE flag should only be added by running MUTABLE.
//
#define VALUE_FLAG_EXPLICITLY_MUTABLE \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(23)


// ^-- STOP BEFORE TYPE_SPECIFIC_BIT
//
// After 8 bits for node flags, 8 bits for the datatype, and 8 generic value
// bits...there's only 8 more bits left on 32-bit platforms in the header.
// Those are used for flags that are sensitive to the datatype.
//

// Endlike headers have the second byte clear (to pass the IS_END() test).
// But they also have leading bits `10` so they don't look like a UTF-8
// string, and don't have NODE_FLAG_CELL set to prevents writing to them.
//
// !!! One must be careful in reading and writing bits initialized via
// different structure types.  As it is, setting and testing for ends is done
// with `unsigned char*` access of a whole byte, so it is safe...but there
// are nuances to be aware of:

// the bits in the header, because some of those bits give information about
// the nature of the cell's storage and lifetime.  Similarly, if bits are
// being copied from one cell to another, those header bits must be masked
// out to avoid corrupting the information in the target cell.
//
// !!! Future optimizations may put the integer stack level of the cell in

// Additionally, operations that copy need to not copy any of those bits that

//  VALUE CELL DEFINITION (`struct Reb_Value` or `struct Reb_Relative_Value`)
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Each value cell has a header, "extra", and payload.  Having the header come
// first is taken advantage of by the byte-order-sensitive macros to be
// differentiated from UTF-8 strings, etc. (See: Detect_Rebol_Pointer())
//
// Conceptually speaking, one might think of the "extra" as being part of
// the payload.  But it is broken out into a separate union.  This is because
// the `binding` property is written using common routines for several
// different types.  If the common routine picked just one of the payload
// unions to initialize, it would "disengage" the other unions.
//
// (C permits *reading* of common leading elements from another union member,
// even if that wasn't the last union used to write it.  But all bets are off
// for other unions if you *write* a leading member through another one.
// For longwinded details: http://stackoverflow.com/a/11996970/211160 )
//
// Another aspect of breaking out the "extra" is so that on 32-bit platforms,
// the starting address of the payload is on a 64-bit alignment boundary.
// See Reb_Integer, Reb_Decimal, and Reb_Typeset for examples where the 64-bit

// RELVAL exists to help quarantine the bit patterns for relative words into

// up, they must be paired with a FRAME! matching the actual instance of the
// running function on the stack they correspond to.  Once made specific,
// a word may then be freely copied into any REBVAL slot.
//
// In addition to ANY-WORD!, an ANY-ARRAY! can also be relative, if it is
// part of the deep-copied function body.  The reason that arrays must be
// relative too is in case they contain relative words.  If they do, then
// recursion into them must carry forward the resolving "specifier" pointer
// to be combined with any relative words that are seen later.
