// `Reb_Track_Payload` is the value payload in debug builds for any REBVAL
// whose VAL_TYPE() doesn't need any information beyond the header.  This
// offers a chance to inject some information into the payload to help
// know where the value originated.  It is used by NULL cells, VOID!, BLANK!,
// LOGIC!, and BAR!.
//
// In addition to the file and line number where the assignment was made,
// the "tick count" of the DO loop is also saved.  This means that it can
// be possible in a repro case to find out which evaluation step produced
// the value--and at what place in the source.  Repro cases can be set to
// break on that tick count, if it is deterministic.
//
// If tracking information is desired for all cell types, that means the cell
// size has to be increased.  See DEBUG_TRACK_EXTEND_CELLS for this setting,
// which can be useful in extreme debugging cases.
//
// In the debug build, "Trash" cells (NODE_FLAG_FREE) can use their payload to
// store where and when they were initialized.  This also applies to some
// datatypes like BLANK!, BAR!, LOGIC!, or VOID!--since they only use their
// header bits, they can also use the payload for this in the debug build.
//
// (Note: The release build does not canonize unused bits of payloads, so
// they are left as random data in that case.)
//
// View this information in the debugging watchlist under the `track` union
// member of a value's payload.  It is also reported by panic().
