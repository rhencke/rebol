    ; !!! This creation of static rules helps avoid creating those rules
    ; every time, but has the problem that the references to what should
    ; be locals are bound to statics as well (e.g. everything below which
    ; is assigned with BLANK! really should be relatively bound to the
    ; function, so that it will refer to the specific call.)  It's not
    ; technically obvious how to do that, not the least of the problem is
    ; that statics are currently a usermode feature...and injecting relative
    ; binding information into something that's not the function body itself
    ; isn't implemented.
