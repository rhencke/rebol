    Purpose: {
        This table is used to make C defines and intialization tables.

        name        - name of datatype (generates words)
        class       - how type actions are dispatched (T_type)
        path        - it supports various path forms
        make        - it can be made with #[datatype] method
        typesets    - what typesets the type belongs to

        What is in the table can be `+` to mean the method exists and has the
        same name as the type (e.g. MF_Blank() if type is BLANK!)

        If it is `*` then the method uses a common dispatcher for the type,
        so (e.g. PD_Array()) even if the type is BLOCK!)

        If it is `?` then the method is loaded dynamically by an extension, and
        unavailable otherwise and uses e.g. T_Unhooked()

        If it is `-` then it is not available at all, and will substitute with
        an implementation that fails, e.g. CT_Fail()

        Note that if there is `somename` in the class column, that means you
        will find the ACTION! dispatch for that type in `REBTYPE(Somename)`.

    Macros: {
        /*
        ** ORDER-DEPENDENT TYPE MACROS, e.g. ANY_BLOCK_KIND() or IS_BINDABLE()
        **
        ** These macros embed specific knowledge of the type ordering.  They
        ** are specified in %types.r, so anyone changing the order of types is
        ** more likely to notice the impact, and adjust them.

         * Note that an "in-situ" QUOTED! (not a REB_QUOTED kind byte, but
         * using larger REB_MAX values) is bindable if the cell it's overlaid
         * into is bindable.  It has to handle binding exactly as it would if
         * it were not a literal form.
         *
         * Actual REB_QUOTEDs (used for higher escape values) have to use a
         * separate cell for storage.  The REB_QUOTED type is in the range
         * of enum values that report bindability, even if it's storing a type
         * that uses the ->extra field for something else.  This is mitigated
         * by putting nullptr in the binding field of the REB_QUOTED portion
         * of the cell, instead of mirroring the ->extra field of the
         * contained cell...so it comes off as "specified" in those cases.
