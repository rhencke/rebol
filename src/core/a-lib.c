// This is the "external" API, and %rebol.h contains its exported
// definitions.  That file (and %make-reb-lib.r which generates it) contains
// comments and notes which will help understand it.
//
// What characterizes the external API is that it is not necessary to #include
// the extensive definitions of `struct REBSER` or the APIs for dealing with
// all the internal details (e.g. PUSH_GC_GUARD(), which are easy to get
// wrong).  Not only does this simplify the interface, but it also means that
// the C code using the library isn't competing as much for definitions in
// the global namespace.
//
// Also, due to the nature of REBNOD (see %sys-node.h), it's possible to feed
// the scanner with a list of pointers that may be to UTF-8 strings or to
// Rebol values.  The behavior is to "splice" in the values at the point in
// the scan that they occur, e.g.
//
//     REBVAL *item1 = ...;
//     REBVAL *item2 = ...;
//     REBVAL *item3 = ...;
//
//     REBVAL *result = rebValue(
//         "if not", item1, "[\n",
//             item2, "| print {Close brace separate from content}\n",
//         "] else [\n",
//             item3, "| print {Close brace with content}]\n",
//         rebEND
//     );
//
// (The rebEND is needed by the variadic processing, but C99-based macros or
// other language bindings can inject it automatically...only C89 has no way
// to work around it.)
//
// While the approach is flexible, any token must appear fully inside its
// UTF-8 string component.  So you can't--for instance--divide a scan up like
// ("{abc", "def", "ghi}") and get the TEXT! {abcdefghi}.  On that note,
// ("a", "/", "b") produces `a / b` and not the PATH! `a/b`.
//
//==//// NOTES ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Each exported routine here has a name RL_rebXxxYyy.  This is a name by
// which it can be called internally from the codebase like any other function
// that is part of the core.  However, macros for calling it from the core
// are given as `#define rebXxxYyy RL_rebXxxYyy`.  This is a little bit nicer
// and consistent with the way it looks when an external client calls the
// functions.
//
// Then extension clients use macros which have you call the functions through
// a struct-based "interface" (similar to the way that interfaces work in
// something like COM).  Here the macros merely pick the API functions through
// a table, e.g. `#define rebXxxYyy interface_struct->rebXxxYyy`.  This means
// paying a slight performance penalty to dereference that API per call, but
// it keeps API clients from depending on the conventional C linker...so that
// DLLs can be "linked" against a Rebol EXE.
//
// (It is not generically possible to export symbols from an executable, and
// just in general there's no cross-platform assurances about how linking
// works, so this provides the most flexibility.)

//=//// SERIES-BACKED ALLOCATORS //////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// These are replacements for malloc(), realloc(), and free() which use a
// byte-sized REBSER as the backing store for the data.
//
// One benefit of using a series is that it offers more options for automatic
// memory management (such as being freed in case of a fail(), vs. leaked as
// a malloc() would, or perhaps being GC'd when a particular FRAME! ends).
//
// It also has the benefit of helping interface with client code that has
// been stylized to use malloc()-ish hooks to produce data, when the eventual
// target of that data is a Rebol series.  It does this without exposing
// REBSER* internals to the external API, by allowing one to "rebRepossess()"
// the underlying series as a BINARY! REBVAL*.
//


//
//  rebMalloc: RL_API
//
// * Unlike plain malloc(), this will fail() instead of return null if an
//   allocation cannot be fulfilled.
//
// * Like plain malloc(), if size is zero, the implementation just has to
//   return something that free() will take.  A backing series is added in
//   this case vs. returning null, in order to avoid null handling in other
//   routines (e.g. rebRepossess() or handle lifetime control functions).
//
// * Because of the above points, null is *never* returned.
//
// * In order to make it possible to rebRepossess() the memory as a BINARY!
//   that is then safe to alias as text, it always has an extra 0 byte at
//   the end of the data area.
//
// * It tries to be like malloc() by giving back a pointer "suitably aligned
//   for the size of any fundamental type".  See notes on ALIGN_SIZE.
//
// !!! rebAlignedMalloc() could exist to take an alignment, which could save
// on wasted bytes when ALIGN_SIZE > sizeof(REBSER*)...or work with "weird"
// large fundamental types that need more alignment than ALIGN_SIZE.

    *ps = s;  // save self in bytes that appear immediately before the data

    // !!! The data is uninitialized, and if it is turned into a BINARY! via
    // rebRepossess() before all bytes are assigned initialized, it could be
    // worse than just random data...MOLDing such a binary and reading those
    // bytes could be bad (due to, for instance, "trap representations"):
    //
    // https://stackoverflow.com/a/37184840
    //
    // It may be that rebMalloc() and rebRealloc() should initialize with 0
    // to defend against that, but that isn't free.  For now we make no such

    // when bytes are used that haven't been assigned.

//
//  rebRealloc: RL_API
//
// * Like plain realloc(), null is legal for ptr (despite the fact that
//   rebMalloc() never returns null, this can still be useful)
//
// * Like plain realloc(), it preserves the lesser of the old data range or
//   the new data range, and memory usage drops if new_size is smaller:
//
// https://stackoverflow.com/a/9575348
//
// * Unlike plain realloc() (but like rebMalloc()), this fails instead of
//   returning null, hence it is safe to say `ptr = rebRealloc(ptr, new_size)`
//
// * A 0 size is considered illegal.  This is consistent with the C11 standard
//   for realloc(), but not with malloc() or rebMalloc()...which allow it.

//  rebRepossess: RL_API

// Alternative to rebFree() is to take over the underlying series as a
// BINARY!.  The old void* should not be used after the transition, as this
// operation makes the series underlying the memory subject to relocation.
//
// If the passed in size is less than the size with which the series was
// allocated, the overage will be treated as unused series capacity.
//
// Note that all rebRepossess()'d data will be terminated by an 0x00 byte
// after the end of its capacity.
//
// !!! All bytes in the allocation are expected to be initialized by this
// point, as failure to do so will mean reads crash the interpreter.  See
// remarks in rebMalloc() about the issue, and possibly doing zero fills.
//
// !!! It might seem tempting to use (BIN_LEN(s) - ALIGN_SIZE).  However,
// some routines make allocations bigger than they ultimately need and do not
// realloc() before converting the memory to a series...rebInflate() and
// rebDeflate() do this.  So a version passing the size will be necessary,
// and since C does not have the size exposed in malloc() and you track it
// yourself, it seems fair to *always* ask the caller to pass in a size.

//=//// VALUE CONSTRUCTORS ////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// These routines are for constructing Rebol values from C primitive types.
// The general philosophy is that this stay limited.  Hence there is no
// constructor for making DATE! directly (one is expected to use MAKE DATE!
// and pass in parts that were constructed from integers.)  This also avoids
// creation of otherwise useless C structs, while the Rebol function designs
// are needed to create the values from the interpreter itself.
//
// * There's no function for returning a null pointer, because C's notion of
//   (void*)0 is used.  But note that the C standard permits NULL defined as
//   simply 0.  This breaks use in variadics, so it is advised to use C++'s
//   nullptr, or do `#define nullptr (void*)0
//
// * Routines with full written out names like `rebInteger()` return API
//   handles which must be rebRelease()'d.  Shorter versions like rebI() don't
//   return REBVAL* but are designed for transient use when evaluating, e.g.
//   `rebValue("print [", rebI(count), "]");` does not need to rebRelease()
//   the resulting variable because the evaluator frees it after use.

//=//// EVALUATIVE EXTRACTORS /////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The libRebol API evaluative routines are all variadic, and call the
// evaluator on multiple pointers.  Each pointer may be:
//
// - a REBVAL*
// - a UTF-8 string to be scanned as one or more values in the sequence
// - a REBSER* that represents an "API instruction"
//
// There isn't a separate concept of routines that perform evaluations and
// ones that extract C fundamental types out of Rebol values.  Hence you
// don't have to say:
//
//      REBVAL *value = rebValue("1 +", some_rebol_integer);
//      int sum = rebUnboxInteger(value);
//      rebRelease(value);
//
// You can just write:
//
//      int sum = rebUnboxInteger("1 +", some_rebol_integer);
//
// The default evaluators splice Rebol values "as-is" into the feed.  This
// means that any evaluator active types (like WORD!, ACTION!, GROUP!...)
// will run.  This can be mitigated with rebQ, but to make it easier for
// some cases variants like `rebValueQ()` and `rebUnboxIntegerQ()` are provided
// which default to splicing with quotes.

//=//// EXCEPTION HANDLING ////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// There API is approaching exception handling with three different modes.
//
// One is to use setjmp()/longjmp(), which is extremely dodgy.  But it's what
// R3-Alpha used, and it's the only choice if one is sticking to ANSI C89-99:
//
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setjmp.h#Exception_handling
//
// If one is willing to compile as C++ -and- link in the necessary support
// for exception handling, there are benefits to doing exception handling
// with throw()/catch().  One advantage is that most compilers can avoid
// paying for catch blocks unless a throw occurs ("zero-cost exceptions"):
//
// https://stackoverflow.com/q/15464891/ (description of the phenomenon)
// https://stackoverflow.com/q/38878999/ (note that it needs linker support)
//
// It also means that C++ API clients can use try/catch blocks without needing
// the rebRescue() abstraction, as well as have destructors run safely.
// (longjmp pulls the rug out from under execution, and doesn't stack unwind).
//
// The third exceptionmode is for JavaScript, where an emscripten build would
// have to painstakingly emulate setjmp/longjmp.  Using inline JavaScript to
// catch and throw is more efficient, and also provides the benefit of API
// clients being able to use normal try/catch of a RebolError instead of
// having to go through rebRescue().
//
// !!! Currently only the setjmp()/longjmp() form is emulated.  Clients must
// either explicitly TRAP errors within their Rebol code calls, or use the
// rebRescue() abstraction to catch the setjmp/longjmp failures.  Rebol
// THROW and CATCH cannot be thrown across an API call barrier--it will be
// handled as an uncaught throw and raised as an error.

//=//// API "INSTRUCTIONS" ////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The evaluator API takes further advantage of Detect_Rebol_Pointer() when
// processing variadic arguments to do things more efficiently.
//
// All instructions must be handed *directly* to an evaluator feed.  That
// feed is what guarantees that if a GC occurs that the variadic will be
// spooled forward and their contents guarded.
//
// NOTE THIS IS NOT LEGAL:
//
//     void *instruction = rebQ("stuff");  // not passed direct to evaluator
//     rebElide("print {Hi!}");  // a RECYCLE could be triggered here
//     rebValue(..., instruction, ...);  // the instruction may be corrupt now!
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//


// The rebQ instruction is designed to work so that `rebValue(rebQ(...))` would
// be the same as rebValueQ(...).  Hence it doesn't mean "quote", it means
// "quote any value splices in this section".  And if you turned around and
// said `rebValue(rebQ(rebU(...)))` that should undo your effect.  The two
// operations share a mostly common implementation.
//
// Note that `rebValue("print {One}", rebQ("print {Two}", ...), ...)` should not
// execute rebQ()'s code right when C runs it.  If it did, then `Two` would
// print before `One`.  It has to give back something that provides more than
// one value when the feed visits it.
//
// So what these operations produce is an array.  If it quotes a single value
// then it will just be a singular array (sizeof(REBSER)).  This array is not
// managed by the GC directly--which means it's cheap to allocate and then
// free as the feed passes it by.  which is one of the reasons that a GC has to
// force reification of outstanding variadic feeds)
//
// We lie and say the array is NODE_FLAG_MANAGED when we create it so it
// won't get manuals tracked.  Then clear the managed flag.  If the GC kicks
// in it will spool the va_list() to the end first and take care of it.  If
// it does not kick in, then the array will just be freed as it's passed.
//
// !!! It may be possible to create variations of this which are done in a
// way that would allow arbitrary spans, `rebU("[, value1), value2, "]"`.
// But those variants would have to be more sophisticated than this.
