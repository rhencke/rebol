    Title: {Rebol-Based C/C++ Makefile and Project File Generator}

    ; !!! Making %rebmake.r a module means it gets its own copy of lib, which
    ; creates difficulties for the bootstrap shim technique.  Changing the
    ; semantics of lib (e.g. how something fundamental like IF or CASE would
    ; work) could break the mezzanine.  For the time being, just use DO to
    ; run it in user, as with other pieces of bootstrap.

    Description: {
        R3-Alpha's bootstrap process depended on the GNU Make Tool, with a
        makefile generated from minor adjustments to a boilerplate copy of
        the makefile text.  As needs grew, a second build process arose
        which used CMake...which was also capable of creating files for
        various IDEs, such as Visual Studio.

        %rebmake.r arose to try and reconcile these two build processes, and
        eliminate dependency on an external make tool completely.  It can
        generate project files for Microsoft Visual Studio, makefiles for
        GNU Make or Microsoft's Nmake, or just carry out a full build by
        invoking compiler processes and command lines itself.

        In theory this code is abstracted such that it could be used by other
        projects.  In practice, it is tailored to the specific needs and
        settings of the Rebol project.
