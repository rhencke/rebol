//
// <review> ;-- Now that emterpreter is gone
// * This extension expands the RL_rebXXX() API with new entry points.  It
//   was tried to avoid this--doing everything with helper natives.  This
//   would use things like `reb.UnboxInteger("rebpromise-helper", ...)` and
//   build a pure-JS reb.Promise() on top of that.  But in addition to the
//   inefficiency intrinsic to such approaches, reb.UnboxInteger() has to
//   allocate stack for the va_list calling convention.  This disrupts the
//   "sneaky exit and reentry" done by the emterpreter.  All told, adding
//   raw WASM entry points like RL_rebPromise_internal() is more practical,
//   and happens to be faster too.
// </review>
//
// * Return codes from pthread primitives that can only come from usage errors
//   are not checked (e.g. `pthread_mutex_lock()`).  We only check ones from
//   circumstances like system resource exhaustion (e.g. `pthread_create()`).
//   This tradeoff balances readability.  Example precedent:
//
//   https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15492-f07/www/pthreads.html
//
// * If the code block in the EM_ASM() family of functions contains a comma,
//   then wrap the whole code block inside parentheses ().  See the examples
//   which are cited in %em_asm.h
//
// * Emscripten's pthread build thankfully includes MAIN_THREAD_EM_ASM.  It's
//   useful, but can't take care of *all* of our mutex/signaling concerns  The
//   reason is that when you're finished running a JS-AWAITER you want the
//   worker thread to stay blocked even though the code you asked to run has
//   synchronously finished.  The only way around this would be if you could
//   use `await` (you can't...and also it would limit error handling)
//
// * We used to block the main thread while Rebol code for a promise was
//   running on the worker.  But it's rude to lock up the main thread while
//   Rebol is running long operations (JS might want to repaint or do some
//   other handling in parallel) -or- it might want to ask for cancellation.
//   So another way needs to be found.

//=//// HEAP ADDRESS ABSTRACTION //////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Generally speaking, C exchanges integers with JavaScript.  These integers
// (e.g. the ones that come back from EM_ASM_INT) are typed as `unsigned int`.
// That's unfortunately not a `uintptr_t`...which would be a type that by
// definition can hold any pointer.  But there are cases in the emscripten
// code where this is presumed to be good enough to hold any heap address.
//
// Track the places that make this assumption with `heapaddr_t`, and sanity
// check that we aren't truncating any C pointers in the conversions.
//
// Note heap addresses can be used as ID numbers in JavaScript for mapping
// C entities to JavaScript objects that cannot be referred to directly.
// Tables referring to them must be updated when the related pointer is
// freed, as the pointer may get reused.

    // The GC can be triggered when we're running Rebol code on either the
    // GUI thread or worker thread (in the USE_PTHREADS build).  If we're on
    // the worker we have to ask the main thread to remove the table entry
    // for the native.  We can do it asynchronously assuming that all these
    // queued asynchronous requests will be processed before an ensuing
    // synchronous request.
    //
    // !!! If a lot of JS items are GC'd, it's going to be inefficient to
    // pile these onto the GUI.  Especially if the main thread is blocked for
    // some reason.  All the pending GCs should probably be queued together

//=//// FRAME ID AND THROWING /////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// We go ahead and use the REBCTX* instead of the raw REBFRM* to act as the
// unique pointer to identify a frame.  That's because if the JavaScript code
// throws and that throw needs to make it to a promise higher up the stack, it
// uses that pointer as an ID in a mapping table (on the main thread) to
// associate the call with the JavaScript object it threw.
//
// !!! This aspect is overkill for something that can only happen once on
// the stack at a time.  Review.
//
// !!! Future designs may translate that object into Rebol so it could
// be caught by Rebol, but for now we assume a throw originating from
// JavaScript code may only be caught by JavaScript code.

//=//// JS-NATIVE PER-ACTION! DETAILS /////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// All Rebol ACTION!s that claim to be natives have to provide a BODY field
// for source, and an ANY-CONTEXT! that indicates where any API calls will
// be bound while that native is on the stack.  For now, if you're writing
// any JavaScript native it will presume binding in the user context.
//
// (A refinement could be added to control this, e.g. JS-NATIVE/CONTEXT.
// But generally the caller of the API can override with their own binding.)
//
// For the JS-native-specific information, it uses a HANDLE!...but only to
// get the GC hook a handle provides.  When a JavaScript native is GC'd, it
// calls into JavaScript to remove the mapping from integer to function that
// was put in that table at the time of creation (the native_id).

// is not, we have to wait until the MAIN is idle and isn't making any calls
