; While Startup calls the evaluator (that needs to yield in a general
; sense), it does so before the JavaScript extension has had a chance to
; load.  And that extension contains the natives that call
; emscripten_sleep().  On the downside, this means it can't be debugged
; except with `printf()` during boot.  On the upside, it means that there
; is no way it can need to yield...thus it can run at full speed in WASM
; with no asyncify instrumentation.
;
; By a similar token, Shutdown happens after the JS extension is unloaded
; and also cannot experience yields.

; It seems that failing is believed to potentially cause a yield, this should
