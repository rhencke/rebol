// Windows has a monolithic facility for reading a line of input from the
// user.  This single command call is blocking (also known as "cooked" as
// opposed to "raw") and very limited.  As an initial goal of updating some
// of the very old R3-Alpha input code, the more granular POSIX code for
// implementing a "GNU libreadline"-type facility is being abstracted to
// share pieces of implementation with Windows.
//
// This file will attempt to define the hooks that are shared between the
// Windows and POSIX smart consoles.
//


// !!! Note: %reb-c.h must be included prior to this for proper CPLUSPLUS_11
// detection (MSVC doesn't do this correctly).  We do not do it here because
// of lack of include guards, but maybe we should put include guards in?
//
/* #include %reb-c.h */


// If a POSIX system does not offer Termios features, we assume it might also
// be old enough (or simple/embedded) to not support C99 and variadic macros.
// Without variadic macros, we have to use REBOL_EXPLICIT_END and it makes the
// code less pleasant.  We tie the two things together to say that there is
// no concern for a "smart-terminal-based C89 build"...if you can only build
// with C89 then another aspect of that constraint is that you aren't going
// to get features like command history or tab completion.

// This attempts to get one unit of "event" from the console.  It does not
// use the Rebol EVENT! datatype at this time.  Instead it returns:
//
//    CHAR!, TEXT! => printable characters (includes space, but not newline)
//    WORD! => keystroke or control code
//    VOID! => interrupted by HALT or Ctrl-C
//
// It does not do any printing or handling while fetching the event.
//
// The reason it returns accrued TEXT! in runs (vs. always returning each
// character individually) is because of pasting.  Taking the read() buffer
// in per-line chunks is much faster than trying to process each character
// insertion with its own code (it's noticeably slow).  But at typing speed
// it's fine.
//
// Note Ctrl-C comes from the SIGINT signal and not from the physical detection
// of the key combination "Ctrl + C", which this routine should not receive
// due to deferring to the default UNIX behavior for that (otherwise, scripts
// could not be cancelled unless they were waiting at an input prompt).
//
// !!! The idea is that if there is no event available, this routine will
// return a nullptr.  That would allow some way of exiting the read() to
// do another operation (process network requests for a real-time chat, etc.)
// This is at the concept stage at the moment.
